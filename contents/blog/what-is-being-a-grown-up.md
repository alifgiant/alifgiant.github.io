Understand that
- not all things you want, you can get.
- not all plans you made can be realised.
- you can't be liked by everyone.
- you don't have unlimited time, money and energy
Sometimes..
- you aren't the protagonist in your life.
- you have to let go when you still hold it dear.
- you have to face things you never expect.
- world is do unfair, injustice and corrupt
Life is hard, nobody will say otherwise. That's why they called it a test. If it's easy it will be called a *mock test*.
