Accessibility should never be an afterthought. When we design for accessibility from the start, we create better experiences for everyone.

## The Business Case

Beyond the ethical imperative, accessible design reaches a wider audience, improves SEO, and often leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Key Principles

### Perceivable
All information must be presentable in ways users can perceive—whether through sight, sound, or touch.

### Operable
Users must be able to navigate and interact using their preferred input method—mouse, keyboard, voice, or assistive technology.

### Understandable
Content and interface behavior should be predictable and clear.

### Robust
Content should work across different platforms and assistive technologies.

## Quick Wins

- Add proper alt text to images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
