### Final Project

I build an `IoT platform` to help monitor arrhythmia activity for users. The research is about figuring out how to detect arryhthmia using `PPG` sensor and making `the cloud system` run as fast as possible since the data transfered through the system should reach at least 30Hz. The end product precission is not very good. But it serves as a proof of concept that an IoT based monitoring can be achieved to help patient all over the world whom has a history of cardiac arrest.

Therefore, I had to `works closely with UX designer` to sets up the best way to serves the users needs while keeping the app as small and fast as possible. Some of the solution include `implementing design system with atomic design approach`, a modular code base, and on-demand module.
