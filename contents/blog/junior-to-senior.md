The journey from junior to senior developer isn't just about years of experience—it's about deliberate growth, expanding your impact, and developing leadership skills.

## Year 1-2: Building the Foundation

Focus on mastering your craft. Learn the fundamentals deeply, not just the frameworks.

- Understand data structures and algorithms
- Learn to write clean, maintainable code
- Get comfortable with debugging and problem-solving
- Build personal projects to solidify learning

## Year 3-4: Expanding Your Scope

Start thinking beyond individual tasks and look at the bigger picture.

- Take ownership of entire features
- Mentor junior developers
- Contribute to architectural decisions
- Learn to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

## Year 5+: Leading with Impact

Senior engineers create force multipliers—their work enables others to be more effective.

> "A senior engineer's value isn't in the code they write, it's in the code they enable others to write."

Focus on documentation, setting coding standards, building tools that improve team velocity, and making strategic technical decisions.
